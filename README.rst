===================
Blog Site Project
===================
During this mini project, I created a multi-user blog, which can be thought of as a Company Blog!
The original idea of this project comes from the *First Clone Project*, which is part of the Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp course of Udemy.
