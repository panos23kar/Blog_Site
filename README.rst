About
---------

During this mini project, I created a multi-user blog, which can be thought of as a Company Blog!
The original idea of this project comes from the *First Clone Project*, which is part of the Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp course of Udemy. 

Spicy Elements
-------------------

- **Class Based Views**: LoginRequiredMixin, LoginView, LogoutView, DetailView, DeleteView, UdateView, TemplateView, ListView, CreateView  
- **Function Based Views** combined with *@login_required* decorator and goodies like *reverse_lazy, get_object_or_404 and redirect*
- Django **Object-Relational Mapper (ORM)**
- *App's urls* connnected with *project's urls* **(include)**
- Old school **Regular Expressions** instead of the convenient **slug**
- Register custom models via **admin** and creation of a **Superuser** instance
- **Extension** of templates using a **base.html** template and **loading of static** files
- **for loops** and **conditional statement** in templates
- Template **tags** and **filters**
- **forms.ModelForm** and **form validity** checks
- Custom *Models* with *owned methods* and different *type of fields*
    - Posts go to a draft list before get published.
    - Comments need to be approved before get published
- External JavaScript libraries to provide **Medium** like text capabilities
- CSS to *continuously change the color* of several HTML elements **codepen.io**
- **Bootstrap**
